Welcome to Dagger Tutor!
========================

In this module we will use a dagger module to learn how to make other dagger
modules. Its inceptiony! You were able to successfully run this function so
you are half way to success.

If you have not already, join our Discord so that you can hang out with our
wonderful community of engineers and ask questions if you get stuck.

You can keep going by executing 'dagger call tutor --step=2' in your terminal.
  `,
  step2: `
You made it to step 2!

In the previous command we called a function called 'tutor' and passeed in a
parameter of '2', we will work through the rest of the tutorial the same way.
You can always go to a previous step by reruning 'dagger call tutor --step=X'
or start over with 'dagger call start'.
